I practiced SQL on my own using a 3-month (but with August 2017 being the only whole month), 
8-table free airlines dataset which I was provided with during the SQL module of the data academy I attended. 
Since it is too large to upload I uploaded a diagram of its schema with all the tables.

*Used my preferred database administration tool's "set as default" option on the corresponding database and schema when writing SQL queries.
